# Noname Soccer

**Play football. Don't manage it.**

Arcade-style 11 v 11 soccer — full pitch, cute players, honest rules.
No attributes, no stamina bars, no tactics sliders. Just the match.

## Philosophy

The only edge is playing better. Nothing in a menu puts anyone ahead before kickoff.

- **Equal players** — no pace, shooting, or height stats; shirt numbers 1–11 are identity only
- **No condition systems** — no stamina, form, morale, or injuries that change the match
- **No progression** — no XP, levels, or upgrades
- **No tactics management** — a few balanced formations, locked for the match
- **No hidden modifiers** — no momentum scripting, home advantage, or weather physics
- **Small control set** — move, pass, through, lob, shoot, skill, switch

Difficulty only changes how well the CPU decides — never the physics, never your teammates.
